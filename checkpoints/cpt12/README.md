# Checkpoint 12: PHP Basic Syntax

In this checkpoint you will be working with PHP and writing basic programs.

## Learning Outcomes

At the completion of this checkpoint:

* you will have gained practice writing PHP code for web pages.
* you will be familiar with PHP Basic Syntax.

## Activities

Please find a partner in class and work on this assignment in pairs.
Identify one partner to be the _driver_.
The other partner will be the _navigator_.
The _driver_ will sit at the keyboard and be responsible for typing the code, focused on short term concepts.
The _navigator_ is focusing on long term goals and assisting the driver.
Consider a road trip as an example of a good team.

There are four activities that follow the self-check exercises from chapter 5.2.
Once you complete two activites, switch driver and navigator roles and continue.

Please fill in the header comment with you and your partners CS Lab Username and the date.

### Arthmetic Expressions

What is the result of each of the expression shown for **Self-Check 4**?
Display both the expression and the result in PHP to the user.
The result should be calculate in the PHP source code.

As you look at the expression, see if you can predict what PHP will procude.

Save your source code in _arthmetic\_expressions.php_.

### Pythagorean theorem

Write PHP Code to compute the length of a hypotenuse **$c** of a right triangle, assuming that the lengths of the other sides are stored as **$a** and **$b**. Recall the Pythagorean theorem:

```
a^2 + b^2 = c^2
```

Save your source code in _pythagorean\_theorem.php_.

### Strings

Assuming that you have a string variable stored in a variable $s, what expressions produce:

* The first letter of the string?
* The length of the string?
* The last letter of the string?
* The middle letter of the string?
* The first five letters of the string?

Please print our the result by writing the PHP code for each questions.
Save your source code in _strings.php_.

### Boolean Expressions

What is the result of each of the expression shown for **Self-Check 7**?
Display both the expression and the result in PHP to the user.
The result should be calculate in the PHP source code.

As you look at the expression, see if you can predict what PHP will procude.

Save your source code in _booolean\_expressions.php_.
