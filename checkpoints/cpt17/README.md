### Query Strings

_??? **Discussion Question** for you and your partner ???_

* Where have you seen query string used?
  At the end of a URL when you are navigating deeper into a specific website the Url will change its parameters at the end of the url query. 

In this activity you have been given four example links that use query strings.
Three links are at the top of the page using [google.com](https://www.google.com).
Review the URL and query string to understand how they are used.

[Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/) is a site for getting a random photo.
The page details how to use there service by crafting a URL.
Some of the properties are using a query string.
Craft three URLs that link to specific images on there site.

* Review the details of the URL and query string.
* Add three links to the Photo List for three specific images on the site.

### HTML Forms

A HTML form can generate a query string for a specific URL.
Create a form that will take the user to a random image when they submit the form.
The form should collect the _specific image_ and _crop gravity_ values and submit them to _Lorem Picsum_.

* Create a HTML form to build the query string and send the user to photo on [Lorem Picsum](https://picsum.photos/).
* The form should have two fields and a submission button:
  * _specific image_
  * _crop gravity_
* Add a default value to help the user find a nice starter image.
* Use HTML and CSS to nicely display the form to the user.

_Stretch Goal:_

Add support for the _blurred_ query string property.
