Please fill in the header comment with you and your partners **CS Lab Username** and the date.

### Read CSV File to 2D Array

_??? **Discussion Question** for you and your partner ???_

* Why would you store information in a CSV file?
    It's makes it easier for reading it in and out of a file, and helps with compatability. 
    Arrays can be read in different ways and this is a good way of organizing it. 
    
In this activity you will read _roster.csv_ into a 2D array.
Write a PHP function that reads the file and returns an array.
The function should be written in the _functions.php_ file.
Remember to put your CS Lab usernames in the _functions.php_ file.

* Write a PHP function to read the CSV file.
* Use **print_r()** to verify the function is working correctly.
* Only write code in the _functions.php_ file.

### Display 2D Array in a Table

Now print the roster in a HTML table on the _roster.php_.
Using the function you wrote in the first activity, now display the data in a web page.
If needed, write any supporting PHP functions.
Embedded the necessary PHP to print the roster in an HTML table.

* Add a PHP include statement to bring in your function.
* Use HTML standards to display the roster data.
