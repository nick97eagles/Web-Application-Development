# Checkpoint 29: Program Logic

In this checkpoint you will be writing JavaScript code.

## Learning Outcomes

At the completion of this checkpoint:

* you will have gained practice writing logic and looping in JavaScript.
* you will be familiar with basic program logic concepts in JavaScript.

## Activities

For this checkpoint, you will continue pick new partners based on a in-class activity.
Please find your partner in class and work on this assignment using [Pair Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming).
During the class please switch driver and navigator roles about halfway through class.

Please fill in the header comment with you and your partners **CS Lab Username** and the date.

### Discussion Questions

Discussion Questions for you and your partner.

* Why does JavaScript have both an == and === operator?
* What is the difference?

 == checks value while === checks both value and type 
 
### Grade Calculation

Use JavaScript to calculate the letter grade for the students based on there score percentage.

* Use a loop.
* Calculate the students letter grade.

Letter grades:

* A is 90 and above
* B is 80 to 89
* C is 70 to 79
* D is 60 to 69
* F is 59 and less

Fill in the column in the table that is missing the letter grade.

### CS Lab Account Names

The CS Lab account names are created using the first four of the last name followed by the first two of the first name.
Add JavaScript to your _department.js_ file to create the account name and save it to the span _cs\_lab\_account_.
You may start with your code from the previous checkpoint and extend it for a few special cases.

Standard format:

* first four of the last name
* followed by the first two of the first name.

Special cases:

* The last name has fewer than four characters.
  * For each letter less then four, add an extra character from the users first name to make sure you have six characters in the account name.
* If the total characters in both first and last name is less then six, add extra characters at the end to make sure they have size characters.
