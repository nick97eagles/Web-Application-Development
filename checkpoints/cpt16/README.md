## Activities

For this checkpoint, use the same partners as Monday (the partner list from the board).
Please find your partner in class and work on this assignment using [Pair Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming).

The activities for today involve reusing code and using PHP _include_ statements.
During the class the instructor will announce its time to switch driver and navigator roles and continue.

### Reusing HTML and CSS

_??? **Discussion Question** for you and your partner ???_

* When would you want to use a PHP include statement? (HTML, CSS, logic, data)

In this activity you have been given five PHP files with similar HTML and content.
Determine what HTML code is repeated and could be moved to an include file.
Create the include file(s) needed to reduce the copied code.

* Use the PHP _include_ statement to reuse HTML.
* Create as many files as needed to reduce the total line count.

### Generate the Multiplication Table in PHP

The multiplication tables could be generated from php instead of static HTML.
Create a PHP function to print the multiplication table.
Now update each of the pages to used your PHP function.

* Add a PHP include statement to bring in your function from _functions.php_.
* Write one function that could be used on all five pages.
* Incorporate your function.

_Stretch Goal:_

Update the tables to continue the table to 20 instead of just 5.
