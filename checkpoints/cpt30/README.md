# Checkpoint 30: Advanced JavaScript Syntax

In this checkpoint you will be writing JavaScript code.

## Learning Outcomes

At the completion of this checkpoint:

* you will have gained practice writing and using arrays and functions in JavaScript.
* you will be familiar with basic arrays and functions concepts in JavaScript.

## Activities

For this checkpoint, you will continue to used the partners set up on Mondays class for the in-class activity.
Please find your partner in class and work on this assignment using [Pair Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming).
During the class please switch driver and navigator roles about halfway through class.

Please fill in the header comment with you and your partners **CS Lab Username** and the date.

### Discussion Questions

Discussion Questions for you and your partner.

* What do the _slice_ and _splice_ methods do on arrays?
* How do they differ?

### Letter Grade

Create a JavaScript function that takes in a percentage and returns a character of the letter grade.

### Grade Calculation

Use JavaScript to build an array to store all the students scores.
After entering or removing a score, update the list of scores, the average and the letter grade.
The score list should be comma separated values in the appropriate HTML tag.
The average and letter grade also have designated tags.
Connect the buttons, _add_, _remove_, _sort_, and _clear_, with an appropriate JavaScript function to perform that action.

* Use an array.
* Calculate the student's average score.
* Calculate the student's letter grade.

Calculate the letter grade for the students based on their score percentage using the following information:

* A is 90 and above
* B is 80 to 89
* C is 70 to 79
* D is 60 to 69
* F is 59 and less

Fill in the scores entered, the average score and the letter grade.
